# Bachelor Thesis in Computer Science 
In this thesis I wrote about my stage in Var One Nord Est s.r.l. (ex Sinapsi Informatica), in this stage I studied the company's existing infrastructure :
- **SAP B1**: studied the main modules of the ERP SAP B1
- **RESTful APIs**: understood and practiced with the APIs of SAP B1, using Postman
- **SOAP webservices**: understood and modified the company's SOAP webservices in PHP, to link their mobile app with SAP B1 and the underlying SQL database 
- **Microsoft SQL server**: used this application to analyze the underlying database of the company "below" the SAP B1, where SAP actually stores data
- **Add-ons**: scripts in .NET, visual basic or C#, to customize the SAP B1 software to every client needs. To do these add-ons I downloaded the SAP B1 SDK, and called its functions. An example of add-on is to automatically print a report once you create a new invoice.
