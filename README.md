# Bachelor Thesis in Computer Science 
In this thesis I wrote about my stage in Var One Nord Est s.r.l. (ex Sinapsi Informatica).
## Company's infrastructure
In this stage I studied the company's existing infrastructure :
- **SAP B1**: studied the main modules of the ERP SAP B1
- **RESTful APIs**: understood and practiced with the APIs of SAP B1, using Postman
- **SOAP webservices**: understood and modified the company SOAP webservices in PHP, to link their mobile app with SAP B1 and the underlying SQL database 
- **Microsoft SQL server**: used this application to analyze the underlying database of the company "below" the SAP B1, where SAP actually stores data
## C# add-ons
In the last part of the stage I started to create something of mine, some kind of software. 
**Add-ons** are scripts in .NET, VB.NET or C#, to customize the SAP B1 software to the client needs. 
I did a few add-ons in C#, using the SAP B1 SDK. 
### Add-on example : Print of an equipment data instance
An example of an add-on I made during the stage is this:

is to automatically print a report once you create a new invoice, this can be done by calling functions of the SDK and coding a bit.
